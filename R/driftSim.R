#' Individual based model for evolution of influenza viruses
#'
#' Implementation of an R/C++ individual based model for simulating evolutionary dynamics of influenza binding avidity and antigenic drift in a human population with adaptive immunity.
#'
#' The package itself is well described in the vignettes available at \url{www.github.com/jameshay218/driftSim}. If you want to get started here, look at \code{\link{exampleParameters}} for example parameter values to get going and the \code{\link{run_simulation}} documentation. Also might be worthwhile looking at \code{\link{runSimulationApp}} if you want to use the shiny app.
