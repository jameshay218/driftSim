\title{Individual based model for transmission with viral loads}
\description{
Implementation of an R/C++ individual based model for simulating a multi-variant epidemic with explicit viral kinetics dictating transmissibility and recovery.
}
\details{
The package is based on a previous ABM with vignettes available at \url{www.github.com/jameshay218/driftSim}. If you want to get started here, look at \code{\link{exampleParameters}} for example parameter values to get going and the \code{\link{run_simulation}} documentation. Also might be worthwhile looking at \code{\link{runSimulationApp}} if you want to use the shiny app.
